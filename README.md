Java Employee Payroll System Project Using OOPS Concepts
* Introduction
The Java Employee Payroll System Project is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to efficiently manage employee payroll details in an organization. This system supports both full-time and part-time employees, calculates their salaries, and offers management functionalities such as adding, removing, and updating employee records.

Key Concepts Implemented:
Inheritance: Creating abstract classes for Employee and concrete subclasses (FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee).
Polymorphism & Method Overriding: Implementing abstract methods to calculate salaries for different types of employees.
Encapsulation: Protecting employee details using private attributes and providing access through getters.
Abstraction: Hiding complex salary calculations using abstract methods.
Features:
Full-Time & Part-Time Employee Payroll: Salaries calculated based on monthly salary or hourly rate.
Payroll Management: Add, update, and remove employees from the payroll system.
Terminal-based User Interface: Simple interaction through the command line to manage employee details.
Learning Outcomes:
Designing an Employee Payroll System using OOP principles.
Creating abstract classes, concrete subclasses, and implementing inheritance.
Understanding encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and method overriding.
Implementing a terminal-based user interface for interaction.
Calculating salaries for both full-time and part-time employees with abstract methods.
Managing employee records, salary updates, and removal using a payroll system.
